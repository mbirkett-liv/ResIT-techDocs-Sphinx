Research IT - Technical documents
*********************************

Welcome to Research IT's technical document set, which holds learning materials, references, and resources for all research computing services at the University of Liverpool. If your research has a computational element there's likely something for you here. Resources include:

	* introduction, tutorials, and optimal performance tips for the :doc:`Barkla high-performance computing <barkla/barkla>` (HPC) cluster.
	* introduction and tutorial for the :doc:`HTCondor high-throughput computing <htcondor/htcondor>` (HTC) pool.
	* resources for :doc:`those developing research software <rse>`, including topic-specific advice on languages, compilers, packages or libraries, tools, and other resources.
	
While these documents should be sufficient for most users, they're not intended to replace published materials on such topics. Our documents aim to:

	#. get researchers up and running as quickly as possible, whilst giving an informative overview of opportunities.
	#. advise of specific considerations for Liverpool's facilities, e.g. on usage, best performance, or regulations.

Where beneficial, links are given to valuable materials found elsewhere, e.g. on software engineering, HPC, or HTC. We're always looking to improve the quality or extent of this documentation set, especially where improvements would help other researchers at Liverpool. Please contact us with any suggestions at rit-support@liverpool.ac.uk.
